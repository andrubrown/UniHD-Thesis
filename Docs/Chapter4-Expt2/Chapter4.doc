Model 2 – Dictionary Learning Based

Decompostion based methods
Basis vectors learnt
Sparse Coding
How it is helpful ( might go into discussions and introduction )
Shortcomings of the model
Multi Scale approach

Algorithm
	- Matrix Decompostion
	- Overcomplete basis
	- Mapping to get the GT
	- Mean Removal
	- Enhancement
