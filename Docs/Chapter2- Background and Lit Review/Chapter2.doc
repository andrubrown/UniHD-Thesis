What is Machine Learning ?

The study dealing with the process of learning characterstic information from data is called Machine Learning. Give some data, X , a machine learning algorithm would learn a mapping function f(X) → y. The learnt model than can be used to make predictions on previously unseen data X'. The aim of the machine learning algorithm is to learn a generalized model, to make the best possible predictions on the new previously unseen data.

A machine learning algorithm comprises of a training and a prediction step. During the training phase, the algorithm is fed with data points (known as training observations/instances). Each training instance is described by a number of features in form of a feature descriptor. A feature set can learned or computed to describe/represent each instance. Based on whether the training data has the ground truth label associated with it or not, the machine learning algorithms can be divided into two types



Depending on whether the data is labelled or unlabelled, the machine learning algorithms can be divided into two types namely :
	* Supervised Learning Algorithms
	* Unsupervised Learning Algorithms


Supervised Learning Algorithms

Give a training set of labelled data, superivsed learning algorithims fit a model to the training set with the aim of predciting the unknown labels for the test instances ( observations). During the training phase, the algorithms learns the unkown parameters for the model.

[Example of a learning algorithm]


Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

In an unsupervised learning settings, the task is to find group relations between instances of the unlabelled training dataset with a subsequent aim of categorizing or clustering the data. The algorithms aims to understand the general properies/structure in the dataset.
