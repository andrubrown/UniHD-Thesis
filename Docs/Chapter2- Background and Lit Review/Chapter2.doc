What is Machine Learning ?

The study dealing with the process of learning characterstic information from data is called Machine Learning. Give some data, X , a machine learning algorithm would learn a mapping function f(X) → y. The learnt model than can be used to make predictions on previously unseen data X'. The aim of the machine learning algorithm is to learn a generalized model, to make the best possible predictions on the unseen data.



Depending on whether the data is labelled or unlabelled, the machine learning algorithms can be divided into two types namely :
	* Supervised Learning Algorithms
	* Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
